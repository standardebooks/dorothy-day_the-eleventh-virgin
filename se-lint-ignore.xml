			<reason>Unfortunately, none of the standard CSS selectors work well for this case. We want to target the second (and last) em tag of the whole chapter, but :nth-of-type and :last-of-type are relative to the parent of the em tag, which will be a p tag. Therefore, in order to target this tag without using a special class you would have to use a p:nth-of-type selector, which is unreadable and would involve counting the exact number of paragraphs. Using a custom class here also has some ancillary benefits since “underlined” has some semantic meaning appropriate to what is being described in the text.</reason>
